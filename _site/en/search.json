The analysis focused exclusively on “urban” census radii, covering 27.91% of the basin’s surface area but representing 96.21% of the total population (2,942,680 inhabitants).\nThe study revealed that the vast majority of the population lives in vulnerable conditions: * Very High: 0.16% * High: 12.50% * Medium: 10.43% * Low: 37.04% * Very Low: 39.83%\nThe Health Index revealed widespread needs (driven by a lack of basic sanitary services), whereas the Housing Index showed generally better conditions with specific pockets requiring state intervention.\n\nSpatial Findings\n\nHigh QLI: Areas closest to CABA and high-density urban zones (often surrounding railway stations) showed the highest quality of life values.\nLow QLI: Conversely, areas in close proximity to water bodies tended to have the lowest values.\nBasin Distribution: No clear distinction was observed between the middle and lower basins in terms of QLI, though the middle basin presented more rural and mixed-use zones.\n\n\n\nFuture Work\nThe project proposes the development of an online interactive map to provide open access to this data and facilitate future updates."
